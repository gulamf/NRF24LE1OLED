# NRF24LE1OLED
Library for interfacing NRF24LE1 to a 0.96inch OLED 128x64 I2C SSD1306 screen

This library is a conversion of Smart Prototyping's OLED.txt from here
http://www.smart-prototyping.com/image/data/2_components/Arduino/100952%20OLED%200.96inch%2012864%20display%20module%20blue/OELD.txt

The original library uses bitbang and interfaces to a SPI display.
This library replaces the bitbang with NRF24LE1 I2C.
